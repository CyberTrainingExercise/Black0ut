# WIP Statement

Operation Black0ut is not only the largest and most complex CTX ever created, it took 4 hours and ~70 cadets to simply excute. Currently this repository contains all of the needed code, but the specifics for orchestration are not up to repository standards. It is currently recommended as a resource for jump-starting a personalized CTX, but not as a stand-alone CTX. See [Operation Starcom](https://github.com/CyberTrainingExercise/Starcom) for a scaled down version.

# CTX - Operation Black0ut

Welcome to Operation Black0ut, a Cyber Training Exercise (CTX) designed for i5 cadets.

This CTX was designed to test cadets for leadership competencies in a high intensity simulation. This simulation will be carried out in the land domain, virtual air domain, and in the cyber domain.

## System Overview

Below is the recommended system diagram. Changes in scale are encouraged to meet particular needs.
